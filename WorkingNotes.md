- Setup project
- Write Out README & Specs
- Play around with Postman and API calls to confirm data retrieval capabilities
- Write out a Fragment (for Main Activity) that returns a list of Congress Members to display
  (can retrieve all in either Senate or House, or retrieve by State in Senate or House)

POSSIBLE INITIAL WORKFLOW:
- Main (search Congress or View Saved Reps List - 2 buttons)
- SearchCongressActivity spits up a huge ArrayList after 2 API calls for House and Senate (same ArrayList though)
- A filter field allows user to narrow down list by name or state

INITIAL WORKFLOW (prior to Saved Rep List):
- Main (search by Senate or House)
- House Search (List All Reps and Button to Search by State)
- House State Search
- Senate Search (List All Reps and Button to Search by State)
- Senate State Search


- Potential APIs:
 - ProPublica - https://www.propublica.org/datastore/api
    KEY: xzqwp0Af8w6THZ9mlEzTkNqIcd4R6Ryrkr8jl9Xy  (in Postman: put this in Header as "X-API-Key", not in Params!)
 - Google - https://developers.google.com/civic-information/
 - GovTrack - https://www.govtrack.us/developers/api
